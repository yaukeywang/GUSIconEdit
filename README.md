# GUSIconEdit

A generally used iTunes style edit control for searching items in other controls on Windows platform.

## Features

* Collaborate with any MFC control in which you want to search items with just few code.
* Fast, easy to use, customize theme, text color and background color.

## Requirements

*Windows only.
* The pre-build example is based on Window7, but it works pretty good in my own project under WindowXP.
* The example project is created by Visual Studio 2008.
* You should know that the Edit control you used as GUSIconEdit must have a ES_MULTILINE style.
